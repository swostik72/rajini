Rajinikanth has often been referred to as the most popular film actor in South India by the media and audiences.
 In 2015, a film about his fandom, For the Love of a Man, premiered at the 71st Venice International
 Film Festival. His popularity has been attributed to "his uniquely styled dialogues and idiosyncrasies in
 films, as well as his political statements and philanthropy". Many also cite reasons for Rajinikanth's 
 popularity as coming from his larger-than-life super-hero appearance in many films, supported by gravity-defying
 stunts and charismatic expressions, all while attempting to maintain modesty in real-life.Almost every film
 of Rajinikanth has punchlines delivered by him in an inimitable style, and these punchlines often have a message
 or even to warn the film's antagonists. These dialogues are usually fabricated to create new ones or even taken 
 in a comical way, but do not fail to create a sense of entertainment among viewers. It is suggested by
 the media that actresses such as Gouthami and Nayanthara got their initial breakthrough after co-starring with 
 Rajinikanth very early in their careers, giving other aspiring actors the urge to work with him. Rajinikanth
 is also the only Indian actor to be featured in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) syllabus, in a 
 lesson titled From Bus Conductor to Superstar. After opening his first official Twitter account in 2014,
 Rajinikanth received over 210,000 followers within 24-hours, which according to The Economic Times was deemed 
 by social media research firms as the fastest rate of followers for any Indian celebrity, as well as among the
 top-10 in the world. Much like Chuck Norris facts, "Rajinikanth facts" or "Rajinikanth jokes" are widely 
 circulated in text messages and memes over the Internet.
